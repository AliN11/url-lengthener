# URL Lengthener

Tired of your URLs being just too darn short? Worry no further, as [aaa.aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.com](https://aaa.aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.com/) has got your back. No need to be anxious about people thinking the size of your URL is too small, as it will guarenteed be the largest one around. What are you waiting for, give it a go!

Your date will be impressed with the sheer size of your URLs, and forget having to take time spelling them out to your coworkers, just yell at the top of your lungs. Want to automate it? Check out [the docs](/docs.md) for more info.

Disclaimer: Since there is a maximum letter count to a URL, there is a slight chance your resulting URL will be too long to use. No worries, just try running it through a site like [bit.ly](https://bitly.com/) and then paste that one over here. Every resulting url ends up having a minimum number of characters, so your URL will still be plenty long!
